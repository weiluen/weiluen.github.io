#Update Eight

##1. What did you do this past week?

We've finally setup our groups for SWE. We've setup the slack channels and incorporated the girhub hooks. We've been debating over whether to go with Angular or React as a frontend framework. We've also started to debate how we should split up the work for the project. Some of our team members have more expertise when it comes to backend development and others frontend. Prof. Downing made a good point in class, "if all of your developers are SQL whizzes but no one knows anything else, you'll be in trouble." We're trying to organize our team around that principle.

##2. What's in your way?

Well, SXSW is in my way. I purchased a badge (really, quite expensive). So this next week, I'll probably be going out to a ton of SXSW events and networking meetups. I'm not sure if this was a wise decision, but it's one I already made. I wish I was better at knowing how much time I have and budgeting my time accordingly. I'm really hoping that I can sell my badge later in the week and then focus on school work and my own projects. 

##3. What will you do next week?

Next week I will be doing motsly SXSW festivities. I'm going to go out and try to meet a lot of people and learn about current industry trends that are happening. I think, in a field as quickly moving as software, it's important to have a strong understanding of the things that are shaping the landscape and the trends that are happening. I can't wait to learn more this week!


##tip-of-the-week

Slack - Slack is an insanely useful messaging platform for work related tasks. It has really cool integrations and hooks that allow you to customize channels and create programmable bots that can perform certain commands for you. Slack is the type of tool that helps you get the work you need to get done quicker with less latency lost to communication!
