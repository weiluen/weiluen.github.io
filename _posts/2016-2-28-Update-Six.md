#Update Six

##1. What did you do this past week?
This past week I worked on school work for Algorithms and I had a rough week with work. I've also had a family tragedy that has forced me to become more disengaged from school. I really don't want to do that because I want to ramp up my ability to learn this semester, but the tragedy is of such a magnitude that I feel as if it is unavoidable. I'm going to try and use school work as a means to distract myself from what's going on. I've also started to select teams for the SWE main project, which is exciting.

##2. What's in your way?
As mentioned in the update above, I had a family tragedy that prevented me from working as much as I would've liked. Keeping myself focused on school right now will serve as an appropriate distraction. I've also been having issues still with taking on too much at work, and I am considering quitting my job. Additionally, I need to do data analysis for research for my professor. I thought that I was going to do this over the weekend, but I've run out of time. I need to reduce my workload.

##3. What will you do next week?
This week will largely consist of studying for the exam that we have in SWE on Thursday. I'm not sure that I'm ready and there are quite a few readings that I need to catch up on. I haven't finished all of the readings that we need to for the class. I'll  probably prepare by going back over the lecture notes and google docs, and I'll try to code out the functions that we learned in class by hand. I think this will be an effective way of preparing for hte exam in the course.


##Tip of the Week
I've been using S3 storage for a project called poli (getpoli.co). A great place to register a domain name is namecheap.com. They sell really cheap domains and don't try ot hustle you for other services. I would recommend namecheap to other students looking to purchase any kind of domain. They also have really intuitive and simple configuration settings
