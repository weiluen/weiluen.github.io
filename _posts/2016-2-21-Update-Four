1. What did you do this past week?
This past week we we worked on the Netflix project. It wasn't really that time intensive, but we left in a hanging assert and forgot to take it out. We didn't notice this error when we ran the text because we forgot to run it on probe.txt. There was not a none type in our acceptance test set. There was, however, in our probe.txt. We learned our lesson and will be sure to test against output before submitting in the future.

2. What's in your way?
I think I'm going to have to decrease some of my work responsibilities to keep up to speed on my coursework. I already have my summer secured, so I think experience is less important at this point than being awake and energetic in class. I'm excited to learn from some of my classes this semster and my classes this semester are a fantastic opportunity to push me forward as a software engineer.

3. What will you do next week?
I'd like to read through the Javascript book and begin preparation for the SWE test. It's awesome that we have typed up notes in the Google docs. I think it'll be an extremely valuable resource. 


Tip of the Week:

One cool thing I've started to use this week is Asana. Asana is a fantastic tool for managing your projects and your todo list. We have a lot of team projects in Mobile News App Design, so ordering the tasks and having them in a centralized place can organize your software development team. I might try ot use Asana for this class when we start to have larger groups!
