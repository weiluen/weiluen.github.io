##1. What did you do this past week?

This past week I've been hard at preparing for the test in SWE. This test was quite challenging and I feel that I could've done better if I had more time on the test. The test really was a good way to evaluate my understanding of SWE at this point. I'm excited to assemble my group and start working on the next project for SWE. I really need to start doing better in the class because I'm worried that we only have two tests in this class. This week I essentially reviewed materials for SWE and tried to get caught up with work.  

##2. What's in your way?

I was going to quit work last week, but I felt like I would be letting down my coworkers too much. I'm starting to hesitate on quitting the job actually. My research professor has been very kind in giving me leniency on timelines for some of the work that I had promised to perform. I need to double down on my commitments and just tough it out until spring break. I really believe that these next two weeks could be the time that I get caught up with my work. 

##3. What will you do next week?

Next week our team will setup the github repo and Asana and Slack channels so that we can commmunicate and tart cordinating dates for working on the SWE project. Now that we've isolated a team we can start thinking of tasks and how to divide them up for SWE. We can also start some sort of a formal project management system sot hat we can guarantee everyone is on board. 

##tip-of-the-week

Asana - is a fantastic project management tool. You can try it at asana.com. This is a program that lets you track the progress of a particular project. You can also use it as a hub for communication between the different members of your team. I would say that it is very similar to trello.
