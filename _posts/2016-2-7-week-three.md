##Blog Questions

##1. What did you do this past week?
This past week I worked on the first assignment. I had told myself that I would start and make a plan at the beginning of the week but multiple things got in my way and I didn't end up working hard (and consistently) the way that I thought that I should. I wanted to get everything finished to work on my Algorithms homework and my work for other classes. Instead of making a structured plan, I ended up waiting until the last minute to work on the SWE project. That cannot happen in the future.
 
##2. What's in your way?
The main impediment to me getting started early was work. I’ve had a tremendous amount of work at the startup that I work at currently. I need to learn how to budget my time better. I’ve started to use Fantastical & Wunderlist to budget my time more effectively. This week I’ve started to track my time and I’ve entered in my assignments into a calendar to effectively track the time required to complete a particular project. I got over my trepidation at meeting with my research professor (PI) and he’s agreed to add me as a co-author on the upcoming paper. This will be my second publication. I have my work cut out for me this week, but I need to just face my fears.
 
##3. What will you do next week?
The second project is up now. I’ve already chosen a partner for the project, so we should be able to start on it early. Working on the project this week instead of waiting a week will put us in a position to finish early and get the most out of this class. I chose to take SWE this semester because I wanted to learn better software engineering practices, and I don’t want to squander it by being lazy.
 
##Tip-Of-The-Week:
I found a website last week called livecoding.tv. It’s fantastic for interview prep and as a casual channel to watch when you have a few minutes of downtime. I’ve done coding challenges with people from across the world and learned about different software frameworks that I otherwise wouldn’t have had any exposure to.
